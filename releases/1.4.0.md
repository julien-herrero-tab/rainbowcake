# *1.4.0*

Twentieth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new

### Integration of requireKTX

Instead of providing its own extensions for requiring values from Bundles, RainbowCake now depends on [requireKTX](https://github.com/zsmb13/requireKTX) to handle these operations. The `require` style methods in RainbowCake are now deprecated and will be removed.

### Updated Koin module to use Koin 3.x

Migrated the Koin integration module from 2.x to 3.x, including the change of dependency coordinates from `org.koin` to `io.insert-koin`.  For more about the 3.x version of Koin, see [its documentation](https://insert-koin.io/docs/setup/v3).

Thanks to [Benjiko99](https://github.com/Benjiko99) for notifying me about this change.

### Minor things

- Expose a `CoroutineScope` as the receiver of the lambda passed to `execute` methods
- Mark `ioContext` as `@InternalRainbowCakeApi` instead of using deprecations on it
- Migrate to an up-to-date Maven publishing setup
