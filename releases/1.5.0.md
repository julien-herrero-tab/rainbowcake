# *1.5.0*

Twenty-first release of RainbowCake.

## What's new

### Dagger Hilt support

Using [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)? RainbowCake now has you covered! Huge thanks to [stewe93](https://github.com/stewe93) for contributing this.

1. Include the new Hilt artifact:

    ```groovy
    implementation "co.zsmb:rainbow-cake-hilt:$rainbow_cake_version"
    ```  

2. Set up Hilt following the [official Android guide](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).

3. Call into the `getViewModelFromFactory` function of the `co.zsmb.rainbowcake.hilt` package in
   your Activities or Fragments.

Check out the `hilt-demo` module for an example of a basic setup.

Note: You may also use multiple DI solutions within the same RainbowCake project simultaneously, for example if you're migrating a project piece by piece. Even shared ViewModels will work!

**There is now a [Blank Hilt](https://github.com/rainbowcake/sample-blank-hilt) starter project available showcasing a blank app set up with RainbowCake's Hilt support.**
